## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- The signed macOS installer (Apple Silicon + Intel) now builds and ships;
  `0.1.0` targeted the since-retired `macos-13` runner image, so that release
  shipped without the macOS `.pkg`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **`whiskerless` Python library** — fully-local MQTT control + telemetry for the
  Whisker Litter-Robot 4:
  - LR4 wire codec, command catalog, and a typed state model that decodes both raw
    firmware integers and cloud-style strings defensively.
  - A push-first `LitterRobot4Client` with a self-healing MQTT connection and
    write → read-back → retry for the firmware's commit-latency registers.
  - Device-agnostic BLE (esp-idf protocomm) re-provisioning with a self-contained
    pure-Python protobuf codec (no `protoc` build step).
  - A `safety` guard that refuses brick/reset-class commands (`0xAC`/`0xA4`/`0xAD`)
    unconditionally and gates motor / untraced commands.
- **`whiskerless` CLI** — `provision`, `monitor`, `state`, `read`, `set`,
  `clean-cycle`, and a guarded raw `send`.
- **Home Assistant integration** (HACS) built to Platinum standards: fully async,
  fully typed, `local_push`, with **MQTT discovery** (robots appear as Add/Ignore
  cards), diagnostics, translations, and per-robot config entries (any number of
  robots).
- **Documentation** — protocol reference, register map, command catalog,
  compatibility matrix, setup guides, recovery guide, and the reverse-engineering
  writeup.
- **Standalone CLI binaries** built on release for users who want the BLE
  re-provisioner without installing Python.
